Activity 1: https://github.com/YWK616/hello-world

did not actually write about myself on the readme-edits, don't know how mandatory this is?

Activity 3 Pull request: https://github.com/UVA-CS3240-S18/Lab2Fork-103/pull/37

Activity 3 Fork: https://github.com/YWK616/Lab2Fork-103

The improvement I made was adding a print line to indicate that the game is not over, and some small spelling changes. I wasn't completely sure what changes would be harmful to the programs, so I made a change that does not seem negative.
